## Vending Machine Application

### Overview
This project is a Vending Machine application developed using PHP and Laragon. It allows users to select from a list of products, specify the quantity, and view a purchase summary including the total number of items and the total amount due.

### Features

- **Product Selection**: Users can choose from 5 different items.
- **Quantity Option**: Users can specify the quantity for each selected item.
- **Purchase Summary**: After selection, users can view a summary of their purchase.
- **Total Calculation**: The application calculates the total number of items and the total amount due.
- **Static Login System**: The application includes a static login system with three user types:
  - **Admin**: Has full access to all features and settings.
  - **Content Manager**: Can manage product listings and oversee inventory.
  - **System User**: Can make purchases and view their purchase history.

## Static Login System Overview

### Overview
The static login system is designed to provide secure access to the Vending Machine application, allowing different user types to interact with the application based on their roles. This system utilizes predefined credentials for authentication and ensures that users can only access features relevant to their permissions.

#### User Types
1. **Admin**
   - **Access Level**: Full access to all application features and settings.
   - **Capabilities**: Manage users, products, and view comprehensive reports.

2. **Content Manager**
   - **Access Level**: Intermediate access focused on product management.
   - **Capabilities**: Add, edit, or remove products and maintain inventory.

3. **System User**
   - **Access Level**: Limited access for purchasing and viewing history.
   - **Capabilities**: Browse products, make purchases, and view their purchase history.

#### Login Functionality
- **Authentication**: Users authenticate using predefined credentials specific to their user type.
- **Redirection**: Upon successful login, users are redirected to their respective dashboards, where they can access features based on their roles.
- **Security**: The static nature of the login system ensures controlled access, minimizing the risk of unauthorized use.

This static login implementation enhances the overall security and usability of the Vending Machine application, ensuring that each user can efficiently perform their designated tasks.
